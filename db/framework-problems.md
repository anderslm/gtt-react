Frameworks will always put themselves first, and therefore much of the folder structure is forced upon you.

I wasn't able to change it very much, as **components**, **pages** and **public** can't be changed.

That is the price of using **React** and probably a price we're prepared to pay.

**Node** doesn't help either, as there is no way of creating **packages** or **projects** - which leaves us with only the folder structure, which **React** prohibits us from changing...
